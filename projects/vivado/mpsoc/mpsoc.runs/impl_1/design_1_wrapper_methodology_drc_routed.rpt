2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock ap_clk is defined downstream of clock clk_pl_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks ap_clk and clk_pl_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks ap_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_pl_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_pl_0 and ap_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_pl_0] -to [get_clocks ap_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks ap_clk and clk_pl_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks ap_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_pl_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_pl_0 and ap_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_pl_0] -to [get_clocks ap_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks ap_clk and clk_pl_0 are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#2 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks clk_pl_0 and ap_clk are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock ap_clk is created on an inappropriate internal pin design_1_i/adder_0/U0/ap_clk. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>
