# This is a incomplete Xilinx tool tutorial based on version 2019.1
It only shows a simple design flow of software/hardware for Xilinx MPSoC. It is INCOMPLETE because it does not cover everything you need to know about Xilinx design tool. Furthermore, the hardware as well as its linux appliation software in this tutorial are both not tested on board. 

## Xilinx High Level Synthesis

This tutorial shows how to create an simple adder VHDL design from C++ code using Xilinx HLS tool. 

### [HLS Project from Scratch](https://github.com/wincle626/IncompleteXilinxToolTutorals_2019.1/blob/master/docs/README_HLS.md)

## Xilinx Vivado Design Suit

This tutorial shows how to create an simple vivado project from scratch using the VHDL source from HLS. It also shows how to create a custom peripherial IP using the vivado and how to design an IP block based design for MPSoC using the AXIS bus interface.

## Xilinx Software Development Kit

This tutorial shows how to do simple data streaming from ARM processor to the custom peripherial IP on FPGA using linux applications. Surely, it could be done in Bare Meta mode but it needs more comprehensive knowledge and skill to combine those low level library and interfaces.
